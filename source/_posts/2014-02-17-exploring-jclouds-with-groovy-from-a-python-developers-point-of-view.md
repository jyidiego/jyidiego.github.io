As python developer I was curious to know if there was a way to explore jclouds. I think it's fair to say that
jclouds is more mature the libcloud, the python version of jclouds. There are several options to
do this, one of which is to use Jython. However in exploring a library written in Java I've always felt that
it might be better to explore using the Java language. Obviously this is just an opinion and really the point
of this blog is not to debate which is better, but to offer another option. At first glance it may seem odd
to learn jclouds through another language like Groovy until you learn what the language was primarily designed for.
